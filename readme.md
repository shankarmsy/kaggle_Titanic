#Work Area for predicting Titanic Survivors (Kaggle)
This is my repo for hosting code and data for the Titanic survivor prediction challenge provided by Kaggle. I will likely use some of this content to create blog posts (if I come up with something interesting) to share what I've learnt. I also intend to attempt solutions in both Python and R but will host both solutions in IPython notebooks.

Feel free to use this for your own reference or learning. Just clone the repo or download the .ipynb files. The IPython notebooks can also be viewed online below:
